aim - introduction to python

theory -The math library in Python is a built-in module that provides standard mathematical functions and constants for use with real numbers
data types in python - int (integers, whole numbers without decimals).
float (floating-point numbers, with decimals).
string(for words).
The if...else statement in Python is a fundamental control flow structure used for decision-making. It allows a program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to True or False. 

algorithm - minicalculator
enter two inputs a ,b
additon = a+b
subtraction= a-b
multiplication = a*b
division=a/b
exponent=a**b

area of circle algorithm-
import math library .
take radius input r.
use import.math to find the area.
formulae=,math.pi*r*r
display the values

if else algorithm-
Define or input the two numbers you want to compare and store them in variables (a,b).
Use an if statement with a comparison operator to check the first condition.
If the first condition is True, execute the code block under the if statement.
 check an alternative condition if the first one was False.
display the values.


cocnlusion-
we learnt about varoius datatypes in python , made a mini calcultor
and also used examples of if else statements
